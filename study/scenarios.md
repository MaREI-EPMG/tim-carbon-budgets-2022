# Scenarios

Here we describe scenarios to include in the study.

## General assumptions:
- Baseline assumptions as previously
- No CCS in Industry
- fixed sectoral budgets (coming soon)
- Elec: As SOEF baseline. Growth constraints should be flexible enough to allow upper limits to be achieved  

## Scenario 1 - Electrification heavy
- SNSP limit as Accelerated Decarbonisation but up to 5GW solar, 7GW offshore, offshore starting 2026

## Scenario 2 - Demand heavy
-  LED 
-  incl. data centres

## Scenario 3 - Other options
- higher bioenergy
- district heating
- CCS
- switching in industry: Higher biogas blend in food & beverages; need research on cement (replacement for coke and coal?); other basic metals (electrification?)

## Scenario 4 - Balacned
- Elec: as Accelerated decarbonisation 
- Half-LED
- constraints on technologies
